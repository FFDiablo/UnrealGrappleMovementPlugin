/**
 * Custom character movement component that supports grapplingâ€‘style movement.
 * It removes radial velocity while the character is attached to a grapple, creating
 * a pendulum effect similar to the grapple mechanics in Worlds Adrift.  When the rope
 * length is exceeded the character is snapped back to the end of the rope to ensure
 * a constant length.  Rope length and anchor point are supplied by a separate
 * Grapple component.
